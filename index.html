                <h2>Elephant</h2>
                <p><span>Elephants</span> are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three
                    species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the
                    Asian elephant. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast
                    Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct,
                    families of the order include mammoths and mastodons.</p>
